Open `localhost:[chosen-port]` in your browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console. Linting currently follows [eslint-config-airbnb-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-standard)

### `npm test`

Runs tests.

### `npm run build`

###Troubleshooting

If you run into the following error message `Error: Error watching file for changes: EMFILE`, you'll need to install watchman. See [here](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) for installation instructions.
